## Description

News are unique like snow-flakes in there content, the sender and the time they were posted. I want to create a installation that prints real-time "tweet-flakes" from all over the world on small thermo-paper snippets and let them "rain" down on the visitors. 
The small and lightweight printouts "live" only a few seconds while the fly through the air before the are walked upon and forgotten. I want the visitors to realize that these *transience* and *worthlessness* mass of *creaking* tweets under there shoes can also be picked up again, read, kept of thrown away. By combining a real-time node.js-backend with a lightweight RaspberryPi module with an attached kiosk printer I want to show an alternative and haptic way to experience some random tweets of the world.
