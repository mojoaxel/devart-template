## The Idea ##

The idea of printing news, tweets or other content on thermal-paper is nothing really new.
There are many examples for implementation and experiments, but as far as I know the big majority of them was implemented after my prototype was shown in 2007.

After realizing the first prototype, I myself was stunned by the sheer mass of "wastepaper" that was created. With this experience in mind, I now want to realize a big working installation that better illustrates the **mass** and **transience** of modern news streams.

Not by reading these short moments in a human's life on a small screen but by holding them in the hand, standing on a big pile of them, and seeing them rain down creates a feeling of **connectedness"" to this moment in the world.

Of course it would be easy to show live tweets on a screen or project them onto a wall, but this would not be a new and unexpected thing to do and therefore probably would not help inspire the visitors.

"Is this already art? What if I step on them?" or "Am I supposed to take one of these?" are some questions visitors of a museum usually do not ask themselves. This experience of uncertainty is what, for me, is a big part of modern art.
