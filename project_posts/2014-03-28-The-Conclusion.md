## The Conclusion ##

Now it is the 28.03.2014 17:00 GMT - one hour to the submission deadline - and I can report that I have taken some important steps to realizing the installation:
 * I have a concept and know what I want do do
 * I found a suitable printer and a supplier who is willing to provide me with a test-device for development.
 * I have also taken some major steps in implementing the software, registered an API-Key at Twitter and have a running demo-client with streaming live tweets.
 
Now I have to connect the printer to a RaspberryPi and adopt the client to print new tweets. 
 
To be honest I'm quite happy with the status. I've been thinking about this project for years and now in just a few days I have made some promising progress. I have to say, that the DevArt competition really gave me the drive to finally get something going. I don't expect to get into the next round but now I really want to finish the project now show it somewhere.

Thanks Google and all involved for creating DevArt!
